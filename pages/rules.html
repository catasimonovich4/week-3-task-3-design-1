              The common interest that members of the Association share is to
              inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair
              play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or
              referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to
              disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey background,
              expertise, accomplishments or standing.

                IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within
                a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions
                should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and
                older.

                Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum of
                100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating
                in the state competition program that are unable to provide a
                field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the
                State Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee
                to inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a
                waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from
                leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an
                acceptable field may be required to play all their games away.
